How to use this nice piece of software ?
Now updated version 2 with 1 beta 1 stable relase.

2-) Register the telegram. (Some number are banned from telegram 
just clear apps data and reset ur modem for getting new numbers.)

3-) Go to my.telegram.org sign in with ur registered number.

4-) Click API development tools and create new api for desktop. (Only need to select desktop and fill api name and shortname for it rest can be empty.)

5-) As you can see example config1.cfg create new config as config2.cfg and use creadentials u get in step 4.

6-) Run the interface have fun. (arayuz.exe)

 PS: U can get other channels or groups member list too. Might wanna make ur own github or other copy since there is possibility that someone request me to take this down.
 
 PS2: Default number are best dont use it one account to add more then 15 users. 
 
 (Account status is resetting every 2-3 days so u can use same account after 2-3 days or 24 hours.)
 
 PS3: Do not change the file names and keep them in same folder.
